So right now in my noSQL database, i have a Collection called Messages:
- Messages (doc: id)
-- created at
-- photoURL
-- text (chat message)
-- uid

Before I logged in with different google account, it was displaying messages. Now it's not displaying messages, but the messages are getting added to Firebase. That means the problem is in the code that displays the messages.





collection
doc
research firestore

friends inside each user
friends is an array of emails,
if you hit x it erases doc, if you hit check it adds the email to their' friends collection and deletes it from the send

firestore's documentation build their to-do-list 

c# with React?

Api calls 

when you do set, you need to write document name 

set/add

messages inside each user

collection ID
