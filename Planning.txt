So right now in my noSQL database, i have a Collection called Messages:
- Messages (doc: id)
-- created at
-- photoURL
-- text (chat message)
-- uid

Users: Friends, received requests, sent requests, (confirmations can just delete request docs and add user to "Friends" field)

When you use set() to create a document, you must specify an ID for the document to create.
But sometimes there isn't a meaningful ID for the document, and it's more convenient to let Cloud Firestore auto-generate an ID for you. You can do this by calling add()

Use something like this to add "users"
.add (https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data)
// Add a new document in collection "cities"
db.collection("cities").doc("LA").set({
    name: "Los Angeles",
    state: "CA",
    country: "USA"
})
.then(() => {
    console.log("Document successfully written!"); // maybe in the .then block I can check to see if there's already a request in, and if there's already a request just auto make them friends?
})
.catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error writing document: ", error);
});

friends inside each user
friends is an array of emails,
if you hit x it erases doc, if you hit check it adds the email to their' friends collection and deletes it from the send

firestore's documentation build their to-do-list
