So right now in my noSQL database, i have a Collection called Messages:
- Messages (doc: id)
-- created at
-- photoURL
-- text (chat message)
-- uid







collection
doc
research firestore

friends inside each user
friends is an array of emails,
if you hit x it erases doc, if you hit check it adds the email to their' friends collection and deletes it from the send

firestore's documentation build their to-do-list 

c# with React?

Api calls 

when you do set, you need to write document name 

set/add

messages inside each user

collection ID
